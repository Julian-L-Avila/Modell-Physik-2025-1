All data was collected from a reference point P, located at the bottom-left
corner of the LEGO base.
For P2, the video was reflected about the vertical axis, using the same reference
point P in the video.

The naming format used for the files is as follows:
D0(VideoName)_two(same trial recorded twice)_data_P1(measured angle)

Please note:
The data collected may be affected due to camera movement during the recording.
